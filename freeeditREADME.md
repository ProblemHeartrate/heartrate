This is the freeedit branch, where the primary experimenting/adding can be done while preserving the world in the master branch.
Anyone can upload their edits in this branch, or in a subbranch if they want.
This way, you don't have to be afraid to try your own thing with the code. So take risks and try something to see if it works!
And if they don't work, no big deal, because it won't affect the master branch. 
That's the whole point of GitHub. Everyone can see everyone else's edits, and files can be merged every easily.
By maximizing communication, we ensure that our project goes as smoothly as possible. 
That, and it's also possible to track each contribution that each individual made, so you can be proud of your work in the end.
