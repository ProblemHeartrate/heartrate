# heartrate
This is the heart rate repository for a school specific project.
Only specific members will be invited to commit. Ubiquitous acces is NOT allowed.

For the people that are part of this project...
If you are new to GitHub or have any questions about how it works, feel free to text/email me.
If you decide not to use GitHub, please let me know.
I just thought it would be a good idea since it's basically the google docs of code.

I will be creating the following documents if time allows:
1_A project outline readme
2_A project pseudocode readme
3_Uploading my work so far as a matlab file that everyone can edit.

If you have any more questions/suggestions, please let me know! 
I am excited to work with all of you, and I know this will turn out to be a great project.

Sincerely,
MP
