# heartrate
This is the heart rate repository for a school specific project.
Only specific members will be invited to commit. Ubiquitous acces is NOT allowed.

For the people that are part of this project...
If you are new to GitHub or have any questions about how it works, feel free to text/email me.
If you decide not to use GitHub, please let me know.
I just thought it would be a good idea since it's basically the google docs of code.

I will be creating the following documents if time allows:
1_A project outline readme
2_A project pseudocode readme
3_Uploading my work so far as a matlab file that everyone can edit.

If you have any more questions/suggestions, please let me know! 
I am excited to work with all of you, and I know this will turn out to be a great project.

Sincerely,
MP

>> about getting the mp3 file to run properly(IMPORTANT)
step 1: click on the heartbeat.mp3 file under the freeedit section.
step 2: click on the download button on the right side of the screen.
(This will bring you to a screen that will automatically start playing the file).
step 3: pause the file and set the playtime back to 00:00
step 4: right click the playbutton.
step 5: click save audio as... (it might be different for a mac, I'm not sure yet).
step 6: save it as heartbeat.mp3 (don't forget the .mp3 at the end, it's important. Also, make sure to save it to your matlab folder path).
step 7: download the heartbeat.m code, and run it! The file should be working with heartbeat.m in the master branch.

(this is the end of the readme)
